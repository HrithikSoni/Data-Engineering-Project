# Data-Engineering-Project

**Project Highlights**

**Azure Data Factory (ADF):** Created dynamic pipelines to efficiently ingest data from GitHub APIs.

**Medallion Architecture:** Organized data into Bronze (Raw), Silver (Transformed), and Gold (Serving) layers to ensure quality and accessibility.

**Azure Databricks**: Performed complex data transformations using Spark to optimize data processing workflows.

**Azure Synapse Analytics:** Built a robust data warehouse for detailed data analysis and reporting.

**Power BI Integration:** Connected Synapse Analytics with Power BI to create interactive and insightful dashboards.

**Dataset Management:** Managed comprehensive datasets with schema validation and data governance best practices.

**Dynamic Pipelines:** Implemented parameterization and looping to handle multiple datasets dynamically.

**Architecture**
The project follows the Medallion Architecture, which organizes data into three distinct layers to maintain quality, scalability, and accessibility:

**Bronze (Raw) Layer:**

Purpose: Store raw data as-is from the source without any transformations.
Source: GitHub APIs.
Tools: Azure Data Factory.

**Silver (Transformed) Layer:**

Purpose: Clean, transform, and enrich the raw data for analysis.
Tools: Azure Databricks.

**Gold (Serving) Layer:**

Purpose: Serve refined data to stakeholders through a data warehouse.
Tools: Azure Synapse Analytics, Power BI.
